    "## Question 1: Median of Median Selection on Quick Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    " In the class, we analyzed an approach for pivot selection that used median of 5 medians.  Here we explore what happens\n",
    "with median of 3 medians.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Divide the input array $a$ of size n into $\\frac{n}{3}$ groups of $3$ elements each.\n",
    " 2. Calculate the median of each group of 3 to create a new array $\\hat{a}$ of these medians.\n",
    " 3. Recursively apply the algorithm to find the median of $\\hat{a}$. Let it be $m$.\n",
    " 4. Use $m$ as the pivot element to partition the original array $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    " __(A)__ How many elements in the array $a$ are guaranteed to be less than the chosen pivot $m$? How many are guaranteed to be greater? Assume all elements in the array $a$ are distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    " __(B)__ If $m$ computed using the median of 3 medians were used to partition the array $a$ for a *quickselect* algorithm that is used to find the median of an array $a$, write down the recurrence for $T(n)$, the time taken to find the median of an array of size $n$ using the quick select algorithm with the median of 3 medians trick.\n",
    "\n",
    " __(C)__ The celebrated \"Akra-Bazzi\" method shows that the recurrence $S(n) = S(\\alpha n) + S( (1-\\alpha)n) + \\Theta(n)$ with base case $S(1) = \\Theta(1)$ has solution $S(n) = \\Theta(n \\log (n) )$. Use this to show that median of 3 medians trick fails to achieve a linear time algorithm for quickselect. (**Note** However, as we saw in the lecture, median of 5 medians works to provide $\\Theta(n)$ deterministic selection algorithm or $\\Theta(n \\log(n))$ quicksort that does not depend on randomization in any way).\n",

    " ## Answer #1\n",
    "\n",
    "__(A)__ When we use the median of 3 medians trick, we'll be splitting the original array into $\\frac{n}{3}$ parts of 3 elements each, and finding the median of each of these groups. The median of that array of medians becomes m, our pivot.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that a pivot that yields an imbalanced array leads to a worse runtime complexity. We also know that for each median in our array of medians, there is 1 element smaller and 1 element larger in that 3-element subgroup. We can refer to the median of medians as $\\frac{n}{6}$, or the element found in the middle of a[1]...a[n/3]. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this, we conclude that we are only guaranteed to have, at a minimum, 2 * $\\frac{n}{6}$ = $\\frac{n}{3}$ elements on each side of the pivot (elements larger or smaller than the pivot).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__(B)__ Let's briefly look at the time complexity of this algorithm:\n",
    "1. Divide array into $\\frac{n}{3}$ groups --> $\\Theta({n})$\n",
    "2. Compute median of each group --> 3n = $\\Theta({n})$\n",
    "3. Calculate the median on an array of size $\\frac{n}{3}$ --> T($\\frac{n}{3}$)\n",
    "4. Time to partition on quickselect --> Cn\n",
    "5. Find median on the recursive portion --> W.C., T($\\frac{2n}{3}$) on one side\n",
    "\n",
    "The recurrence can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "T(n) = $\\Theta({n})$ + T($\\frac{n}{3}$) + T($\\frac{2n}{3}$) + Cn\n",
    "\n",
    "= $\\Theta({n})$ + T($\\frac{n}{3}$) + T($\\frac{2n}{3}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "__(C)__ As per the Akra-Bazzi method, an algorithm can run in linear time ($\\Theta({n})$) if [$\\alpha$ + $\\beta$] < 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "As per our recurrence, $\\alpha$ = $\\frac{1}{3}$, and $\\beta$ = $\\frac{2}{3}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $\\alpha$ + $\\beta$ = 1, which is not less than 1. We have proven that the algorithm for median of 3 medians trick cannot run in linear time."
