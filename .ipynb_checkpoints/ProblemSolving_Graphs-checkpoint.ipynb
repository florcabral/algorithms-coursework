    "## Question 1: Arbitrage Opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "An arbitrage in finance is a way to make money for sure without much risk. For instance, suppose 1 USD yields 5 Chinese RMB and 1 RMB trades for 0.4 Euros, and 1 Euro trades for 0.52 USD,  you have an arbitrage opportunity\n",
    "wherein you can take x USD, obtain 5x RMB, and in turn trade them for 2x Euros and finally end up with 1.02x USD back. Every time you exercise this opportunity, you get a 2 cent profit (assuming you can trade for free and there is no spread in the buying and selling prices, but that is another can of worms).\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, arbitrage cannot exist in efficient markets but they can persist for a short amount of time. Electronic traders can then search for such opportunities in real time and rapidly exploit them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a basket of $n$ currencies and for each pair of currencies $(C_i,C_j)$, you are given a ratio\n",
    "$R_{i,j}$ that says that one unit of currency $C_i$ is currently fetching $R_{i,j}$ units of $C_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__(A)__ Given the ratios $R_{i,j}$ write an efficient algorithm that can detect if any arbitrage opportunities currently exist? What is the running time of your algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "(__Hint:__ Make a graph out of the problem data. What does the presence of arbitrage mean for this graph? )\n",
    "\n",
    "__(B)__ We are not just interested in finding an arbitrage opportunity, but also interested in finding the shortest length opportunity, defined as one that involves the smallest number of trades? Naturally, given that prices change\n",
    "and also given that there are trading fees, such opportunities are more desirable. \n",

    "We could represent this problem as a directed graph, where currencies are represented by nodes, and weighted edges connect any pair of currencies $(C_i,C_j)$ for which there is an exchange rate, with the edge's weight being $R_{i,j}$ in the direction $C_i -> C_j$, and $1/(R_{i,j})$ for $C_j -> C_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "An arbitrage would be detected with the presence of a cycle, where we can exchange $C_i$ for $C_j$, $C_j$ for $C_m$, then again $C_m$ for $C_i$, and make money from the difference between our starting and ending amounts of $C_i$. In other words, if our value after traversing the cycle was higher than the starting value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To detect such a cycle, we would first negate all edge weights, then run Floyd-Warshall's algorithm and check if the resulting SP distance matrix has any negative values connecting nodes to themselves (on the diagonal). If there are, then there is a negative-weight cycle, and we know there is a cycle in the original graph. \n",

In other words, the distance from any vertex to another is Infinity, and the distance from any vertex v to itself is 0. We will use a modified version of F-W where we set the distance[v][v] to Infinity. This will allow us to look for the shortest path from v to v, essentially finding the shortest cycle involving v. Once we ran the algorithm and have all values for distance[v][v], we will have the length of the shortest cycle in the graph that contains vertex v for every v. Then, all we need to do is compute the minimum of all these values.\n",

We know that if graph G = (V,E) contains no negative-weight cycles reachable from source node s, then for all reachable vertices the shortest path weight is well defined, even if there are negative edges found. This means if the graph contains a negative-weight cycle reachable from the source s, shortest path weights are not well defined.\n",

Finally, negate the edges once more to get the longest path as the opposite of the shortest path found. \n",

We assign a weight of 1 to every edge, and an edge weight of Infinity if 2 nodes are not connected. Then we sort the nodes in increasing order, to get the order in which meetings are happening. Since we start at $S_1$, we will just need to traverse this graph to $S_n$. \n",
